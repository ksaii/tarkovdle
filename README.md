# Tarkovdle

This repository contains the code for **Tarkovdle**, a passion project that I've built as a guessing game inspired by the game **Escape from Tarkov**. This website is one of my first experiences creating a web app using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, along with **Node.js** on the backend.

## Project Overview

**Tarkovdle** is a daily guessing game where players guess Tarkov weapons based on attributes like ammo types, price range, and type. This project was designed to be an enjoyable and engaging way for fans of the game to test their knowledge!

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: for structuring the web pages
- **CSS**: for styling and layout
- **JavaScript**: for interactive features and game logic
- **Node.js**: for handling backend logic and managing data

## Status

This project is still in development as I continue to improve and learn more about web development. Any feedback or contributions are welcome!
